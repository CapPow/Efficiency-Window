# Efficiency-Window
The following are instructions for a SERNEC Userscript modification written to improve data entry from images. 

Currently, this is a proof of concept and in the wrong hands has the potential to submit bad data or greatly confuse curators and other users of the device this is installed on.
   
This is a hobby effort, the application is limited but when necessary the rates are much faster.

If youâ€™d like to help please do!
 
This is NOT for general distribution: I'm not being greedy, I just don't want unprepared people submitting bad data.
 
Installation
Only supports chrome. Using chrome, download and install the "Tampermonkey App" 
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
Once Tampermonkey is installed, (and presumably activated) navigate to my script repository and a prompt to install the script should be displayed. Install it:
